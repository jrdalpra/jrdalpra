I'm a software engineering manager and leader. I have many years of experience in the industry and a strong track record for delivering results.

I specialize in systems integrations and I led several projects with high success rate.

I'm a results driven, hands-on, technical leader who loves helping and empowering the team to deliver results while they evolve as professionals.

I adapt myself to any tech stack, but I've been working with Java and Python in the latest years.
